# Face Emotion Recognition
## Tip 
You can change the learning parameater by decreasing the batch size from 128 to 100 and increase the epoches > 100 to get good accuracy but dont fell in trap pf overfittingðŸ˜‰. 
## Overview
Face Emotion Recognition is a real-time emotion detection system that uses deep learning to identify emotions from facial expressions. The system utilizes OpenCV for face detection and a pre-trained neural network model to classify emotions.

## Features
- Real-time face detection using OpenCV
- Emotion classification into seven categories: Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Neutral, Sad, and Surprise
- Live webcam-based emotion recognition
- Pre-trained deep learning model for accurate predictions

## Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy opencv-python keras tensorflow
```

## Installation & Setup
1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Ensure the required files (`emotiondetection.json` and `emotiondetection.h5`) are available in the project directory.
3. Run the script using the command:

```bash
python realtime.py
```

## How It Works
1. The script loads the pre-trained deep learning model from `emotiondetection.json` and `emotiondetection.h5`.
2. The webcam captures frames in real-time.
3. Faces are detected using OpenCVâ€™s Haar cascade classifier.
4. The detected face regions are preprocessed and fed into the neural network for emotion classification.
5. The predicted emotion is displayed on the screen in real-time.

## Usage
- The program will automatically start detecting faces and emotions once executed.
- To exit the program, press `q` on your keyboard.

## Notes
- Ensure proper lighting conditions for accurate emotion detection.
- The model expects grayscale images of size 48x48 for proper classification.
